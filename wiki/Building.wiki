#summary How to build fluks.

= Introduction =

fluks depends on a few libraries: libdevmapper, libuuid, and boost.  It also uses an obscure build system called bjam (with other names, as well).


= Details =

_I'll clean this up later, as I learn the way of the wiki:_

libdevmapper comes with device-mapper at http://sources.redhat.com/dm/
libuuid is part of e2fsprogs at http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/
boost is at http://boost.org/

After the libraries are installed, you can run bjam from the directory with the Jamroot file in it.  bjam goes by other names like Boost.Build or Boost.Jam.
