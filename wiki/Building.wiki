#summary How to build fluks.

= Building fluks =

fluks depends on a few libraries: libdevmapper, libuuid, and boost.  It also uses an obscure build system called bjam (with other names, as well).  bjam (Boost.Jam) is derived from FTJam, Perforce Jam before that, and is a part of Boost.Build.


== Details ==

libdevmapper comes with Device-mapper from [http://sources.redhat.com/dm/ sources.redhat.com/dm].

libuuid is part of e2fsprogs from [http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/ e2fsprogs.sf.net].

boost is at [http://boost.org/ boost.org].  If you use C++ but not boost, your life must be miserable.

After the libraries are installed, from the main source directory:

{{{
bjam release
}}}

The resulting binary will be found in the `release/` directory.

== Source code documentation ==

The source code documentation uses Doxygen.  Running `doxygen` or `make doc` will build the HTML.
