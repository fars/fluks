fluks, 'free LUKS', is my unencumbered and nicer (than cryptsetup)
implementation of the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) standard for disk
cryptography. Basically, a header is written to disk that includes the private
key in encrypted form, which is used to read/write from the disk. The private
key can be encrypted by multiple passphrases, allowing for (1) easy to
remember passphrases and (2) the ability to add, revoke, or change the allowed
passphrases.

========================================

BUILDING

    Dependencies:
	libdevmapper from Device-mapper (sources.redhat.com/dm)
	boost (boost.org), at least version 1.35.0
	Boost.Build
	libuuid (multiple sources):
	    e2fsprogs-libs (e2fsprogs.sf.net)
	    util-linux (freshmeat.net/projects/util-linux)
	OpenSSL (openssl.org)
	Linux headers (/usr/include/linux)

    In Ubuntu (ugh), it's at least:
	- libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev
	  libboost-regex-dev libboost-system-dev libdevmapper-dev libssl-dev
	  libudev-dev uuid-dev'
	- Also uncomment the selinux and sepol lines in Jamroot. There has
	  *got* to be a better way to handle static linking dependencies in
	  Unix.

    If you were wondering, libuuid is one of the few BSD-licensed libraries
    in e2fsprogs/util-linux. Now build:

	$ bjam release
	# if it complains about cast6.o, do `bjam fluks release' instead

    This will put a (mostly) statically-linked binary in the `release'
    directory (or it should with reasonable Boost versions).

INSTALLING

    This will install to /usr/local/bin by default. To change the install
    paths, run `bjam --help'.

	# bjam [options] release install
