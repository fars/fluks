fluks, 'free LUKS', is my unencumbered and nicer (than cryptsetup)
implementation of the LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) standard for disk
cryptography.  Basically, a header is written to disk that includes the
private key in encrypted form, which is used to read/write from the disk.
The private key can be encrypted by multiple passphrases, allowing for
(1) easy to remember passphrases and (2) the ability to add, revoke, or
change the allowed passphrases.

========================================

BUILDING

    Dependencies:
	libdevmapper from Device-mapper (sources.redhat.com/dm)
	boost (boost.org), at least version 1.35.0
	Boost.Build
	libuuid (multiple sources):
	    e2fsprogs-libs (e2fsprogs.sf.net)
	    util-linux (freshmeat.net/projects/util-linux)
	OpenSSL (openssl.org)

    If you were wondering, libuuid is one of the few BSD-licensed libraries
    in e2fsprogs/util-linux.  Now build:

	$ bjam release

    This will put a (mostly) statically-linked binary in the `release'
    directory.

INSTALLING

    This will install to /usr/local/bin by default.  To change the install
    paths, run `bjam --help'.

	# bjam [options] release install
